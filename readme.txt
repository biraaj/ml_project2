## Machine Learning Project 2

### Requirements
- Numpy
- python3

### Instructions to Run
- go to code directory and execute the below commands.
- Instruction to run programs for 1 and 2:
	- Run the given command "python run_1_2.py" to see results for softmax regression using bagging and ADAboost.
- Instruction to run programs for 3(K-means):
	- Run the given command "python run_3_kmeans.py" to see results for K-means algorithm.
- Instruction to run programs for 3:
	- Run the given command "python run_3a_b_c.py" to see results for all bits of softmax regression.
- All data is present in data folder.For using different data sets keep the data text files in current folder with similar format as the data sets present in this folder.
- All the functional elements are kept in functions.py

### Notes
- all codes are vailable in parent folder.
- all data is available in data folder.
